<a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/projects/prototypes/21775594"> InVision CW1 prototype for CW2 </a>

<a href="https://dmu-p2607972.github.io/DMU-Year-2-CW2/home.html">Coursework 2 - website</a>

Coursework 2 website is a concept of an artist website where you can try paspartu frames on the pictures/photography art before ordering the picture, frame and paspartu to go together.

Future prospects:

- creating an interactive upload image link to test out picture of your choosing that are not available on the website.
